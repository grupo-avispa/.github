# WASP Research Group

The **WASP Research Group** is a research team at the **University of MÃ¡laga (UMA)** specializing in **social robotics** and **cognitive architectures**. Our main goal is to develop innovative technologies that enable robots to interact more naturally and effectively with humans, integrating advanced cognitive capabilities.

<!-- ## Research Areas

- **Social Robotics**: Design and implementation of robots capable of socially interacting with people in various environments, such as homes, hospitals, and public spaces.
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Development of systems that provide robots with cognitive skills, such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Study and improvement of interfaces and communication methods between robots and humans.
- **Perception and Recognition**: Implementation of algorithms for visual, auditory, and tactile perception, as well as for recognizing human emotions and behaviors. -->

## Main repositories
The group has developed several open-source projects that contribute to the field of social robotics and cognitive architectures. Some of our main repositories include:

### Robot drivers

- **[scitos2](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/scitos2)**: ROS 2 stack designed for Metralabs robots that utilize the MIRA framework, including models such as SCITOS, TORY, MORPHIA, etc.
- **[pioneer_ros2](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/pioneer_ros2)**: ROS 2 stack designed for MobileRobots Pioneer robots.

### Cognitive architectures

- **[dsr_ros](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/dsr_ros)**: A ROS 2 stack that contains agents, interfaces and RQT plugins for connecting to CORTEX architecture using a Deep State Representation (DSR) graph.
- **[dsr_aal](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/dsr_aal)**: DSR agents for Ambient Assisted Living environments.
- **[mqtt_dsr_agent](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/mqtt_dsr_agent)**: DSR agent that communicates with MQTT brokers.
- **[wasp_dsr_planner](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/wasp_dsr_planner)**: Behavior Tree (BT) planner with DSR.

### Perception

- **[ros_perception_pipeline](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/ros_perception_pipeline)**: Collection of perception-related nodes and tools for ROS2.
- **[depth_anything_v2_ros2](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/depth_anything_v2_ros2)**: ROS2 Wrapper for DepthAnything V2 model.

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

- **[rasa_ros](https://github.com/grupo-avispa/rasa_ros)**: A ROS2 wrapper for Rasa NLU, enabling natural language understanding capabilities in robots.

## Collaborations

The group actively collaborates with other universities, research centers, and technology companies to advance the field of social robotics and cognitive architectures.
